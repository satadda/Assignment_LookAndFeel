            The H-1B program facilitates the hiring of nonimmigrant aliens in specialty occupations or as distinguished fashion models, where such roles demand specialized knowledge typically accompanied by at least a bachelor's degree. Its primary purpose is to aid employers who are unable to find the necessary skills within the U.S. workforce by temporarily employing qualified individuals who may not otherwise be authorized to work in the United States. To safeguard both U.S. workers and H-1B nonimmigrants, the law mandates certain standards, including the requirement for employers to attest to the Department of Labor that they will pay H-1B workers wages at least equal to those of similarly experienced and qualified workers, or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment, whichever is higher.

            Foreign workers play a crucial role in the U.S. labor market, particularly in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Research indicates that H-1B workers complement U.S. workers, addressing employment gaps in numerous STEM occupations, and ultimately enhancing job opportunities for all. However, the demand for H-1B visa numbers consistently surpasses the statutory limit set, leading to a shortage of available visas. This shortage underscores the ongoing challenge faced by U.S. employers seeking highly skilled foreign professionals, as they compete for a limited pool of H-1B visa numbers controlled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
